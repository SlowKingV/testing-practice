# Testing practice

> In this exercise, you will write a few practical tests for JavaScript functions using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) library. You should make sure you follow the [AAA pattern](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices#-%EF%B8%8F-12-structure-tests-by-the-aaa-pattern) to make your tests easier for other developers to read and understand. You will also try to use the TDD approach in practice.
